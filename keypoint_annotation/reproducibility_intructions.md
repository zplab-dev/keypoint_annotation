# Human reproducibility tests for keypoint annotations

Thank you for engaging in this incredibly important scientific endeavor! You are making a difference in advancing (my) science. I greatly appreciate your sacrifice.

## Motivation/why should you do this:

In this module you will be annotating the anatomical landmarks for adult C. elegans. These landmarks are “anterior pharyngeal bulb”, “posterior pharyngeal bulb”, “vulva”, and “tail” (examples in other sections). I need human annotated keypoints to show how variable human-annotated values are vs the neural net. Since I am a biased individual and am too close to the data, I need your help in generating this human dataset! 

###  Other reasons you should do this:
  1.	It will greatly help me
  2.	I’m pretty awesome so you should help me
  3.	You’re pretty awesome and care about science
  4.	It shouldn’t take too long

## Instructions:
I have written up a script that will open a riswidget annotator window with the 200 adult C. elegans images you need to annotate. All data and scripts are stored on Lugia.

###  Before you run the script:
1.	Ensure you have the zpl environments set up. If you are just starting out refer to [this Github post](https://github.com/zplab/protocols/blob/master/computer%20protocols/zplab%20Python%20Environment.md) on how to set up your environment.
